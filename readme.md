- Integration of Python and HTML for a seamless user experience.

### Getting Started

#### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Flask
- pandas

#### Detailed Setup
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   - Use Git to clone the repository to your local machine.
   - `git clone [repository-url]`

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   - Install Flask and pandas using pip:
     ```bash
     pip install flask pandas
     ```

3. **Project Structure:**
   - `app.py`: The main Python file with Flask logic.
   - `templates/`: Directory for HTML files.
   - `static/`: Directory for static files like CSS, JS, and images.

#### Running the Application
1. **Start the Server:**
   - Run the Flask application using:
     ```bash
     python app.py
     ```
   - This starts a local server on `http://localhost:5000`.

2. **Accessing the Web Interface:**
   - Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000`.
   - Interact with the web interface to input data and view results.

### API Endpoints (if applicable)
- `/calculate` (GET/POST): Endpoint for performing attribute calculations. Returns processed data based on user input.

### Usage
- The web interface guides users through inputting attribute data.
- Once the data is submitted, the application processes it according to predefined rules in `app.py`.
- The results are displayed on the web interface.
